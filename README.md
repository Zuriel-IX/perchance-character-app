Hi, I'm Zuriel, a 17 years old (in June 2025) student from Argentina, self-taught with a tendency to being a jack-of-all-trades (never getting real deep with anything actually), with a mid-low english level.
This is my first code project, I hope it will be useful for anyone, in any way despite its crudeness, and the fact that I got rather heave assistance from several LLMs and random posts.
To add to my embarrassment, if you see the project history you may see weird pulls and pushs with inconsistent changes and not-so-great commits, with another accidental branch Tauri.
About the branch named "Tauri", its original motive was to make a more advanced app using tauri 2.0 (a crazy idea considering that this is my first app)
I'll try to refine and upgrade this project and make it better and worthy, but I doubt it will get that far.
